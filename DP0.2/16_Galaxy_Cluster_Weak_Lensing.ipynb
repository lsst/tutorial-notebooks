    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitionally bound objects in the Universe. According to the General Relatively, massive objects warp the spacetime, and light follows the curvature of spacetime. Thus, massive objects act like lenses that bend the path of the light emitted from distance sources. This effect is called \"gravitional lensing\". \n",
    "\n",
    "The large mass of a galaxy cluster coherently distorts the images of backgroud galaxies, and this distortion occurs over a large sky area around the cluster. The lensing effect on the shape of a single background galaxy far from the cluster center is small, but the lensing signal can be detected by averaging the shape of many background galaxies. This is because the original shapes of the galaxies are randomly oriented. This effect is called weak gravitational lensing (WL), which shows up in the statistics of a large sample of galaxy shapes. More detailed introduction to cluster WL can be found in review papers (e.g., [Bartelmann & Schneider 2001](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001PhR...340..291B/abstract); [Umetsu 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A%26ARv..28....7U/abstract)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that WL also happens between galaxies and when the light passes through the large-scale structure of the Universe (cosmic shear). Compared to galaxy-galaxy lensing and cosmic shear, the cluster WL signal is generally about 1 magnitude higher (at the level of 10 times). \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook gives an example of detecting lensing signal of clusters using DP0 data."

    "Use the `g` and `r` band color information to remove foreground galaxies, applying relevant flag cuts. Additionally, use the `r` band for shape analysis. Using the `r` band shapes is common in weak lensing studies. The main reason is the balance between seeing and sky brightness for shape measurement ([Fu et al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...933...84F)). Another reason is that Differential Chromatic Refraction (DCR) is weaker in redder bands, which reduces the PSF elongation along the zenith and makes the galaxy's pre-PSF shape easier to measure ([Plazas et al. 2012](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012PASP..124.1113P/abstract)). \n",
