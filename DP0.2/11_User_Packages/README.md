# working with user packages

This tutorial notebook demonstrates how users can install packages and use them within the Rubin Science Platform environment.

**This notebook is in its own sub-directory in order to isolate it from automatic testing.**
All the notebooks in the main directory are regularly and autonomously executed with the latest version of the recommended image as a part of continuous integration of the RSP's services.
However, the repeated installation of these packages is not a useful test of the system.
Thus, the notebook is put into a sub-directory, and the sub-directory's name is added to the list of sub-directories which are exempt from testing.
